# Training with Imitation Learning

### What to Use

If you want to help your agents learn (especially with environments that have sparse rewards)
using pre-recorded demonstrations, you can generally enable both GAIL and Behavioral Cloning
at low strengths in addition to having an extrinsic reward.
An example of this is provided for the Pyramids example environment under
 `PyramidsLearning` in `config/gail_config.yaml`.

If you want to train purely from demonstrations, GAIL and BC _without_ an
extrinsic reward signal is the preferred approach. An example of this is provided for the Crawler
example environment under `CrawlerStaticLearning` in `config/gail_config.yaml`.

## Recording Demonstrations

In order to record demonstrations from an agent, add the `Demonstration Recorder`
component to a GameObject in the scene which contains an `Agent` component.
Once added, it is possible to name the demonstration that will be recorded
from the agent.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/demo_component.png"
       alt="BC Teacher Helper"
       width="375" border="10" />
</p>

When `Record` is checked, a demonstration will be created whenever the scene
is played from the Editor. Depending on the complexity of the task, anywhere
from a few minutes or a few hours of demonstration data may be necessary to
be useful for imitation learning. When you have recorded enough data, end
the Editor play session. A `.demo` file will be created in the
`Assets/Demonstrations` folder (by default). This file contains the demonstrations.
Clicking on the file will provide metadata about the demonstration in the
inspector.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/demo_inspector.png"
       alt="BC Teacher Helper"
       width="375" border="10" />
</p>

You can then specify the path to this file as the `demo_path` in your `trainer_config.yaml` file
when using BC or GAIL. For instance, for BC:

```
    behavioral_cloning:
        demo_path: <path_to_your_demo_file>
        ...
```
And for GAIL:
```
    reward_signals:
        gail:
            demo_path: <path_to_your_demo_file>
            ...
```
