# Training ML-Agents

For a broad overview of reinforcement learning, imitation learning and all the
training scenarios, methods and options within the ML-Agents Toolkit, see
[ML-Agents Toolkit Overview](ML-Agents-Overview.md).

Once your learning environment has been created and is ready for training, the next
step is to initiate a training session. Training in the ML-Agents Toolkit is powered
by a dedicated Python package, `mlagents`. This package exposes a command `mlagents-learn` that
is the single entry point for all training workflows (e.g. reinforcement
leaning, imitation learning, curriculum learning). Its implementation can be found at
[ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/learn.py](../ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/learn.py).

## Training with mlagents-learn

### Starting Training

`mlagents-learn` is the main training utility provided by the ML-Agents Toolkit. It
accepts a number of CLI options in addition to a YAML configuration file that contains
all the configurations and hyperparameters to be used during training. The set of
configurations and hyperparameters to include in this file depend on the agents in your
environment and the specific training method you wish to utilize. Keep in mind that
the hyperparameter values can have a big impact on the training performance (i.e. your
agent's ability to learn a policy that solves the task). In this page, we will review all the hyperparameters for all training methods and provide guidelines and advice on their values.

The view a description of all the CLI options accepted by `mlagents-learn`, use the `--help`:
```sh
mlagents-learn --help
```

The basic command for training is:

```sh
mlagents-learn <trainer-config-file> --env=<env_name> --run-id=<run-identifier>
```

where

* `<trainer-config-file>` is the file path of the trainer configuration yaml.
* `<env_name>`__(Optional)__ is the name (including path) of your [Unity
  executable](Learning-Environment-Executable.md) containing the agents to be trained.
  If `<env_name>` is not passed, the training will happen in the Editor.
  Press the :arrow_forward: button in Unity when the message _"Start training by
  pressing the Play button in the Unity Editor"_ is displayed on the screen.
* `<run-identifier>` is a unique name you can use to identify the results of your training runs.

See the [Getting Started Guide](Getting-Started.md) for a sample execution of the
`mlagents-learn` command.

#### Observe Training

Regardless of which training methods, configurations or hyperparameters you provide,
the training process will always generate three artifacts:
1. Summaries (under the `summaries/` folder): these are training metrics that are updated
throughout the training process. They are helpful to monitor your training performance
and may help inform how to update your hyperparameter values.
See [Using TensorBoard](Using-Tensorboard.md) for more details on how to visualize
the training metrics.
1. Models (under the `models/` folder): these contain the model checkpoints that are updated
throughout training and the final model file (`.nn`). This final model file is generated once
either when training completes or is interrupted.
1. Timers file (also under the `summaries/` folder): this contains aggregated metrics on your training process, including time spent on specific code blocks. See [Profiling in Python](Profiling-Python.md)
for more information on the timers generated.

These artifacts (except the `.nn` file) are updated throughout the training process and finalized
when training completes or is interrupted.

#### Debugging

If you enable the `--debug` flag in the command line, the trainer metrics are logged to a CSV file
stored in the `summaries` directory. The metrics stored are:
  * brain name
  * time to update policy
  * time since start of training
  * time for last experience collection
  * number of experiences used for training
  * mean return

This option is not available currently for Behavioral Cloning.

#### Stopping and Resuming Training

To interrupt training and save the current progress, hit Ctrl+C once and wait for the
model to be saved out.

To resume a previously interrupted or completed training run, use the `--resume` flag and
make sure to specify the previously used `run-id`.

If you would like to re-run a previously interrupted or completed training run and re-use
the same run-id (in this case, overwriting the previously generated artifacts), then
use the `--force` flag.

#### Loading an Existing Model

You can also use this mode to run inference of an already-trained model in Python by
using both the `--resume` and `--inference` flags. Note that if you want to run
inference in Unity, you should use the [Unity Inference Engine](Unity-Inference-Engine.md).

Alternatively, you might want to start a new training run but _initialize_ it using an already-trained
model. You may want to do this, for instance, if your environment changed and you want
a new model, but the old behavior is still better than random. You can do this by specifying `--initialize-from=<run-identifier>`, where `<run-identifier>` is the old run ID.

## Training Set-up

The Unity ML-Agents Toolkit provides a wide range of training scenarios, methods and options.
As such, specific training runs may require different training configurations and may
generate different artifacts and TensorBoard statistics. This section offers a detailed
guide into how to manage the different training set-ups withing the toolkit.

The training config files `config/trainer_config.yaml`, `config/sac_trainer_config.yaml`,
`config/gail_config.yaml` and `config/offline_bc_config.yaml` specifies the training method,
the hyperparameters, and a few additional values to use when training with Proximal Policy
Optimization(PPO), Soft Actor-Critic(SAC), GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning)
with PPO/SAC, and Behavioral Cloning(BC)/Imitation with PPO/SAC. These files are divided
into sections. The **default** section defines the default values for all the available
training with PPO, SAC, GAIL (with PPO), and BC. These files are divided into sections.
The **default** section defines the default values for all the available settings. You can
also add new sections to override these defaults to train specific Behaviors. Name each of these
override sections after the appropriate `Behavior Name`. Sections for the
example environments are included in the provided config file.

You can also compare the [example environments](Learning-Environment-Examples.md)
to the corresponding sections of the `config/trainer_config.yaml` file for each
example to see how the hyperparameters and other configuration variables have
been changed from the defaults.
